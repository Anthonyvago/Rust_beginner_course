# Rust_beginner_course

This repository contains the basic usage of rust. The following falls under 'basic usage':
- arrays
- cli (command line interface)
- conditionals
- enums
- functions
- loops
- pointer references
- strings
- structs
- tuples
- types
- variabels
- vectors

Note: Some comments are in English and some are in Dutch.

## Why?

Normally I only program in C and C++ for embedded systems, but I wanted to try out something new.
As Rust is the "most loved" programming language according to the Stack Overflow community, I wanted to know it's basics.

Also, many companies in the embedded-programming-world are using Rust. As a student, almost ready for the real thing, having knowledge about the basics of Rust can come in handy.

## Usage
Be sure you execute  the following command in the root of the project:

> cargo run <.rs-file>

- The placeholder for the <.rs-file> can be any file inside the following folder: **src/subjects**.
- It is possible to give more than one argument (see example).

### Example:
> cargo run loops.rs arrays.rs

The program will run the function **run()** in both files.
