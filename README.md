# Rust_beginner_course

This repository contains the basic usage of rust. The following falls under 'basic usage':
- arrays
- cli (command line interface)
- conditionals
- enums
- functions
- loops
- pointer references
- strings
- structs
- tuples
- types
- variabels
- vectors 

## Why?

Normally I only program in C and C++ for embedded systems, but I wanted to try out Rust and get to know it's basics as it is the "most loved" programming language according to the StackOverflow community.
